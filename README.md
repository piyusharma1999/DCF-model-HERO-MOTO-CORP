Hero Moto Corp Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis Project

Overview
This project involves a detailed Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis of Hero Moto Corp to determine the intrinsic value of its shares. The analysis uses historical financial data and future projections to estimate the company's free cash flows, which are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. The resulting intrinsic value is compared to the current market price to make investment recommendations.

Project Structure
The project is structured into several key sections, each corresponding to a different worksheet in the Excel file:

1. Income Statement
2. Balance Sheet
3. Cash Flow Statement (CFS)
4. Cost Sheet
5. Working Capital
6. Revenue Schedule
7. DCF Analysis
8. Margin Analysis

Key Components of the Analysis

1. Income Statement: Provides detailed information on revenue, expenses, and profits over the analyzed periods.
2. Balance Sheet: Summarizes the company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity.
3. Cash Flow Statement (CFS): Shows the cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities.
4. Cost Sheet: Breaks down the costs associated with production and operations.
5. Working Capital: Analyzes the company's short-term assets and liabilities to determine liquidity.
6. Revenue Schedule: Details the revenue projections based on historical data and future assumptions.
7. DCF Analysis: The core of the project, this sheet calculates the intrinsic value of the company using the following steps:
   - Forecasting Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF): Projected for FY24 to FY27.
   - Cost of Equity: Calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
   - Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Combines the cost of equity and cost of debt to discount future cash flows.
   - Terminal Value: Estimated using a long-term growth rate.
   - Enterprise Value (EV): Sum of the present value of projected FCFF and the terminal value.
   - Equity Value: Adjusted for cash, debt, and minority interest to derive the equity value.
   - Intrinsic Value per Share: Equity value divided by the number of outstanding shares.

Analysis Summary

- Free Cash Flow Projections: The analysis forecasts increasing FCFF from FY24 to FY27, indicating expected growth in cash generation.
- Cost of Equity: Approximately 11.33%, reflecting the required return by equity investors.
- WACC: Consistent at 11.3%, used to discount future cash flows to present value.
- Terminal Value: Calculated with a 6% long-term growth assumption.
- Intrinsic Value per Share: Calculated to be 3,099.9 INR.

Investment Recommendation

- Current Market Price AS ON 27TH MAY 2024: 5,088.50 INR
- Intrinsic Value: 3,099.9 INR
- Recommendation: Sell. The current market price is significantly higher than the intrinsic value, indicating that the stock is overvalued according to the DCF analysis.

Conclusion

This DCF analysis provides a comprehensive view of Hero Moto Corp's financial health and intrinsic value, serving as a valuable tool for investors. By comparing the intrinsic value with the market price, informed investment decisions can be made.
